Generates a Matrix formation of bools (True => Pixels to Fill at Point(X,Y), False => Transparent Pixels)

Benefits forseen;

Auto scaling/algorithm for Generating Linear Charts (Geometry Class: Points, Lines, Graphs, Labels)
Dynamic Color Distribution
ML/AI Predicitive Bitmap Generation
Dynamic Image Encoding
Lower-File Size

Later Implementation NEEDS;
Usage of GPU/Performance Objects (Memory/Span)
